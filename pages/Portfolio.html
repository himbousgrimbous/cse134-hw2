                        <p>BeeThirsty is a <strong>cocktail machine</strong> which conciles <em>drinking and entertainement.</em><br>

                        <p>This add-on consists of a keyboard which plugs into the main Hive,
                                with each button pushed a sound is played and a specific liquid is poured.
                            This is a modern take on Boris Vian's Pianocktail

                        <p>This add-on is basically a dumb drinking game.<br>
                        Each player holds a handle in one hand, and has a shot in front of him on the BeeBuzzed board<br>
                        The last player to drink his shot receives an electric shock through the handle</p>

                        <p>The Hive is controlled with a raspberry pi 4, the whole gui and backend is coded in python. <br>
                        There is a <b>homemade PCB</b> that controls the 15 pumps by demuxing the signal since the raspberry doesnt have enough GPIOs <br>
                        The add-ons are powered by arduino nanos which communicate with the hive via IÂ²C</p>
